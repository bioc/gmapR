\title{Class \code{"BamTallyParam"}}
\description{
  A \code{BamTallyParam} object stores parameters for
  \code{\link{bam_tally}}. The function of the same name serves as its
  constructor. 
}

\usage{
  BamTallyParam(genome, which = GRanges(),
                desired_read_group = NULL,
                minimum_mapq = 0L,
                concordant_only = FALSE, unique_only = FALSE,
                primary_only = FALSE, ignore_duplicates = FALSE,
                min_depth = 0L, variant_strand = 0L,
                ignore_query_Ns = FALSE,
                indels = FALSE, include_soft_clips = 0L)
}
\arguments{
  \item{genome}{A \code{GmapGenome} object, or something coercible to one.}
  \item{which}{A \code{RangesList} or something coercible to
    one that limits the tally to that range or set of ranges. By
    default, the entire genome is processed.
  }
  \item{desired_read_group}{The name of the read group to which to limit
    the tallying; if not NULL, must be a single, non-NA string.}
  \item{minimum_mapq}{Minimum mapping quality for a read to be counted
    at all.}
  \item{concordant_only}{Consider only what gnsap
    calls \dQuote{concordant} alignments.
  }
  \item{unique_only}{Consider only the uniquly mapped reads.}
  \item{primary_only}{Consider only primary pairs.}
  \item{ignore_duplicates}{Whether to ignore the reads flagged as
    PCR/optical duplicates.
  }
  \item{min_depth}{The minimum number of reads overlapping a position for
    it to be counted.}
  \item{variant_strand}{The number of strands on which a variant must be
    seen for it to be counted. This means that a value of 0 will report
    reference alleles in addition to variants. A value of 1 will report
    only positions where a variant was seen on at least one strand, and
    2 requires the variant be seen on both strands. Setting this to 1
    is a good way to save resources.}
  \item{ignore_query_Ns}{Whether to ignore the N base pairs when
    counting. Can save a lot of resources when processing low quality data.}
  \item{indels}{Whether to return indel counts. The \code{ref} and
    \code{alt} columns in the returned \code{VRanges} conform to VCF
    conventions; i.e., the first base upstream is included. The range
    always spans the sequence in \code{ref}; so e.g. a deletion extends
    one nt upstream of the actual deleted sequence.
  }
  \item{include_soft_clips}{Maximum length of soft clips that are
    considered for counting. Soft-clipping is often useful (for GSNAP at
    least) during alignment, and it should be preserved in the
    output. However, soft clipping can preferentially occur in regions
    of discordance with the reference, and if those clipped regions are
    ignored during counting, the allele fraction is misestimated.
